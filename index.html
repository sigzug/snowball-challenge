                        The clothes in the stores that don’t get sold 
                        will most likely be incinerated. Some companies 
                        choose to burn the clothes in a way to make electricity 
                        back from them. This has been a step in the right 
                        direction. There was an incident with a British company 
                        Burbary in 2018 that was busted on burning a total amount of 
                        almost $40 million. It became an outrage in the public 
                        and the parliament demanded a change. And they did change. 
                        But sadly they were not the only ones.

                    <h2>Who is doing it?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Sadly there's no scarcity of the practice of burning clothes in 
                        the world's companies. Companies from Louis Vuitton to Nike have 
                        all been burning clothes in many years. The worst part about it, 
                        is they mostly do it not because the clothes are longer profitable, 
                        but to maintain exclusivity in the brand by making it more hard to 
                        find. But it’s not only the exclusive companies. H&M were busted by 
                        danish TV for having burned 60 tons of clothing since 2013, both old 
                        and new. There are many more. The fashion industry has been one of the 
                        world's biggest polluters for a long time, and this is one of the 
                        practices that could help.but what can they and we do?

                        Our solution is to keep the donations going. There is clearly a lack of
                         motivation for the companies to keep giving away. We want the donation
                          process to be so simple and easy that it’s embarrassing for the companies.
                           We would also need to keep pressure on the companies through media by 
                           always demanding something from them.
