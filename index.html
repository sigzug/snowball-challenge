                        How are clothing companies wasting so many resources? What are the reasons 
                        behind this? For the sake of protecting their own brands, companies will often 
                        destroy their own unwanted products. This is done to avoid flooding the market 
                        and making it more accessible to the common population. Brands like Gucci and 
                        Chanel are popular due to their expensive prices and limited accessibility. 
                        Making their brands more accessible by selling unwanted products is not in their 
                        interest, and therefore prefer to destroy it. A common method of destroying clothing 
                        products is incineration. The clothes in stores that don’t get sold  will most likely be 
                        incinerated. Some companies choose to burn the clothes in power plants to make electricity 
                        back from them. And that has been a step in the right direction, but it doesn’t make up 
                        even a tiny bit of all the energy used to make the clothes. There was an incident with 
                        a British company called Burbary in 2018. They were busted on burning a total amount 
                        of almost $40 million worth in clothes. An outrage sweeped over the public and the 
                        parliament where pushed to demand a change from the company. This did eventually 
                        lead to them stopping the practice, but they were one of many.

                        Louis Vuitton and Nike are other brands that destroy unwanted products 
                        for the sake for brand protection, and still do to this day. This practice 
                        is not only common within expensive and exclusive brands though. H&M were 
                        busted by danish TV for having incinerated 60 tons of clothing since 2013, 
                        both old and new. After the first news articles came out about this practice, 
                        countless have stepped forward to the public in a lot of companies. The fashion 
                        industry has been one of the world's biggest polluters for a long time now, and 
                        this is a major factor to their wastefulness.

                        Our solution is to keep the donations going. There is clearly a lack of
                         motivation for the companies to keep giving away. We want the donation
                      process to be so simple and easy that it’s embarrassing for the companies.
                       We would also need to keep pressure on the companies through media by 
                        always demanding something from them.
