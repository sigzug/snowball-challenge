                    <h2>Incinerating to dust</h2>
                    <p>
                        The clothes in stores that don’t get sold  will most likely be incinerated. 
                        Some companies choose to burn the clothes in power plants to make electricity 
                        back from them. And that has been a step in the right direction, but it doesn’t 
                        make up even a tiny bit of all the energy used to make the clothes. There was an 
                        incident with a British company called Burbary in 2018. They were busted on burning 
                        a total amount of almost $40 million worth in clothes. An outrage sweeped over the 
                        public and the parliament where pushed to demand a change from the company. 
                        This did eventually lead to them stopping the practice, but sadly they were the one 
                        of thousands.

                    <p>
                        Sadly there's no scarcity of the practice of burning clothes in the world's companies. 
                        Companies from Louis Vuitton to Nike have all been burning clothes in many years and don’t 
                        show any sign of stopping. The worst part about it is that they mostly do it to maintain 
                        exclusivity in the brand. They don’t do it because their storages are full, it’s just to 
                        keep an image. But it’s not only the exclusive and expensive companies that do this though. 
                        H&M were busted by danish TV for having burned 60 tons of clothing since 2013, and it was both 
                        old and new clothes. After the first news articles came out about this practice, countless 
                        whistleblowers have stepped forward to the public in a lot of companies. The fashion industry 
                        has been one of the world's biggest polluters for a long time now, and this is one major reason for 
                        them being one of the worst. What can we do to help them make better and more environmental 
                        choices for the clothes they are throwing away?

                        Our solution is to keep the donations going. There is clearly a lack of
                         motivation for the companies to keep giving away. We want the donation
                      process to be so simple and easy that it’s embarrassing for the companies.
                       We would also need to keep pressure on the companies through media by 
                        always demanding something from them.
