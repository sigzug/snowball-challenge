          How are clothing companies wasting so many resources? What are the reasons
          behind this? For the sake of protecting their own brands, companies will often
          destroy their own unwanted products. This is done to avoid flooding the market
          and making it more accessible to the common population. Brands like Gucci and
          Chanel are popular due to their expensive prices and limited accessibility.
          Making their brands more accessible by selling unwanted products is not in their
          interest, and therefore prefer to destroy it. A common method of destroying clothing
          products is incineration. The clothes in stores that don’t get sold  will most likely be
          incinerated. Some companies choose to burn the clothes in power plants to make electricity
          back from them. And that has been a step in the right direction, but it doesn’t make up
          even a tiny bit of all the energy used to make the clothes. There was an incident with
          a British company called Burbary in 2018. They were busted on burning a total amount
          of almost $40 million worth in clothes. An outrage sweeped over the public and the
          parliament where pushed to demand a change from the company. This did eventually
          lead to them stopping the practice, but they were one of many.

        <h2>Who is doing it?</h2>
        <p>
          Louis Vuitton and Nike are other brands that destroy unwanted products
          for the sake for brand protection, and still do to this day. This practice
          is not only common within expensive and exclusive brands though. H&M were
          busted by danish TV for having incinerated 60 tons of clothing since 2013,
          both old and new. After the first news articles came out about this practice,
          countless have stepped forward to the public in a lot of companies. The fashion
          industry has been one of the world's biggest polluters for a long time now, and
          this is a major factor to their wastefulness.

        <h1>What can we do?</h1>
        <p>
          The only way to ensure change within the clothing industry, is to enforce change through international laws.
          We must support politicans who are willing to stop these wasteful practices, and establish regulations and laws which
          limit or prohibit this kind of brand protection. We must also support the clothing companies who do not destroy their products.
          These method of brand protection can't just be prohobited, but replaced too. Promoting the use of re-usable clothes is also a step
          in the right direction.
